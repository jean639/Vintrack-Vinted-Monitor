# Worker speed and hybrid discovery

Vintrack has two complementary catalog paths:

- **Canonical monitoring** keeps the exact Vinted search URL configured for each monitor.
- **Hybrid discovery** removes only `search_text`, keeps structural filters such as category, brand, size, price, color, and condition on Vinted, then matches the monitor query and anti-keywords locally.

Both paths use the same atomic `(monitor, item)` claim, so only the first path to see an item can enqueue its alert. This is intentionally catalog-based; production discovery does not probe sequential item IDs.

## Recommended rollout

Start with:

```env
DISCOVERY_MODE=shadow
```

Shadow mode runs discovery and records timing without sending discovery alerts. Open a monitor's **Metrics** dialog and compare hybrid detections, early wins, median early lead, and first-delivery detect-to-alert p95. Once the selected proxy pool is stable and early wins are useful, enable:

```env
DISCOVERY_MODE=active
```

Shadow discovery also runs on a healthy shared free-proxy pool so its timing can be evaluated without sending discovery alerts. Active discovery requires at least two dedicated proxies by default. For a short, deliberate free-pool alert test, set `DISCOVERY_ALLOW_FREE_ACTIVE=true`; canonical monitoring stays active if discovery cannot start.

Client selection favors low-latency, successful, idle sessions. HTTP 401/403/407/429 responses cool down the affected session, and hedged-request losers are canceled without being counted as failures. Free discovery uses its own stable client pool, so free-pool refreshes no longer restart the feed or disturb canonical catalog sessions.

## Alert semantics

Dashboard/SSE publishing, Discord, and Telegram use separate bounded worker queues, so a slow external channel cannot stall later items. Without a seller-country filter, the dashboard publishes immediately from catalog data while Discord and Telegram wait for seller enrichment so their alerts include region and rating. A configured seller-country filter remains strict: seller enrichment and the country check complete before the item is published, saved, or alerted.

Operational check counts and success rates use canonical monitor runs only. Discovery runs remain separate telemetry so shadow or free-discovery failures cannot make the primary monitor health look worse than it is.

## Process isolation

Docker Compose runs the latency-sensitive monitor process with `WORKER_ROLE=monitor` and free-proxy imports/health checks with `WORKER_ROLE=proxy-maintainer`. Keep both services running: the maintainer owns free-pool upkeep and detection-telemetry cleanup, while the monitor process only refreshes ready proxy snapshots.

The optional `WORKER_ROLE=id-scanner` process is a separate, shadow-only experiment behind the `preindex` Compose profile. It never sends alerts. See [Pre-index shadow scanner](preindex-shadow.md) for its request budget, metrics, and controls.
